file Handling
# 📂 Week 4 Assignment

## 📖 Description
This project demonstrates **file handling** and **exception handling** in Python.  
It has two main parts:
1. **File Read & Write Challenge** – Reads a file (`input.txt`) and writes a modified version into `output.txt`.
2. **Error Handling Lab** – Asks the user for a filename and handles errors (like file not found or permission denied).
